          There are several types of authentication, categorized based on three main factors: Something you know, Something you have, and Something you are. These factors provide a basis for different methods of authentication. Here are some examples of each:
        </p>
        <ul className="space-y-3 mt-4">
          <li className="flex items-center gap-3">
            <CheckCircle className="text-blue-400 w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0" />
            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Something You Know</strong> — Examples include passwords, certificates, PINs, & security questions.

          <li className="flex items-center gap-3">
            <CheckCircle className="text-blue-400 w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0" />
            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Something You Have</strong> — Examples include both physical possessions, such as smart cards, hardware tokens, and USB security keys, or intangible possessions such as online security codes via authenticator apps.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li className="flex items-center gap-3">

            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Something You Are</strong> — Relates to biometrics, which is based upon measurable physical characteristics to verify identity. Examples include fingerprint scans, facial recognition, voice, & iris scans. This type of authentication is known to be expensive due to requiring higher level technology to fully implement.

          Generally, there are guidelines that are meant to be followed when generating/creating a safe password. Here are the main guidelines:

            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Personal Information</strong> — When creating a password, do not include any personal information about yourself that could put your account in jeopardy. If malicious users are able to obtain personal information about yourself, it is relatively easy for them to figure out your password.
            </p>
          </li>

            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Reusing Passwords</strong> — Passwords should not be reused across different websites or applications because if a malicious user knows the password to any of the websites you use, they can try that password for any other website you use, putting all your accounts in danger.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li className="flex items-center gap-3">

            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Originality</strong> — Create original, unique, & random passwords that are not taken directly from the dictionary or are common words.

          <li className="flex items-center gap-3">

            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Password Creation</strong> — When creating your password, make sure your password meets these criteria: (8-10 characters minimum, mix of uppercase & lowercase letters, & use of special characters/symbols)

        <p className = "mt-2">
          Phishing is the use of bogus emails & websites to trick you into supplying an attacker or malicious user with personal/confidential information. However, there are some ways to identify phishing emails/attacks. Here are the easiest ways to do so:
        </p>
        <ul className="space-y-3 mt-4">
          <li className="flex items-center gap-3">
            <CheckCircle className="text-blue-400 w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0" />
            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Misspellings/Incorrect Grammar</strong> — Misspellings or incorrect grammar in emails are an indicator of a phishing attack. Some attackers do not check for mistakes when creating these malicious emails, while authorized companies hire professional writers to address users which will most likely not contain any grammar mistakes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li className="flex items-center gap-3">
            <CheckCircle className="text-blue-400 w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0" />
            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Email Address not Matching Sender</strong> — Professional emails sent out by companies will contain email addresses that align with the sender name. On the other hand, phishing attacks usually have misalignment between sender name and email address, a strong indicator that the email is fake.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li className="flex items-center gap-3">
            <CheckCircle className="text-blue-400 w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0" />
            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>URL Spoofing</strong> — Most phishing attacks contain links within the email, asking you to provide personal information in some sketchy website. Typically, the URLs of these links are malicious and do not point to a company's real website when hovered over. This is why you should always hover over any URLs that you think might lead you to malicious sites.

        <p className = "mt-2">
          Social engineering are threats specifically made pertaining to human factors within the technology environment. Because humans are susceptible to influence by other people (unlike technical defenses which are much stronger & less vulnerable), it makes social engineering so effective in the world of cybersecurity. But what specifically about human vulnerability makes it so effective?
        </p>

            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Wanting to Help</strong> — The action of helping someone alone makes any person feel better about themselves inside. Social engineering experts often abuse this by trying to manipulate the helpfulness of the average human. One example is Piggybacking, in which an authorized user may let an unauthorized user into a restricted area, simply because they want to help that person.
            </p>
          </li>

            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Avoiding Confrontation</strong> — Authorized people may feel uncomfortable with confronting or directly making contact with someone who they believe should not be in a restricted place. As a result, many of these people do not have the courage to go up and confront someone who, in their mind, should not have access to a restricted place. Another way of describing this is that people do not want to "make a scene". 
            </p>

            <p className = "leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Sloppy Mistakes</strong> — Sloppy mistakes are one of the main reasons why social engineering is so successful. Rather than needing to enter a secure system and obtaining information that way, humans are vulnerable to making silly mistakes such as leaving passwords directly out in the open, trashing (not shredding) important documents, and even leaving computers with authorized access unattended.
