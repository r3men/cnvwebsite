              Julia Beaufort-Stuart, also known as Queenie in her confession and Verity as her code name, is one of the main protagonists and narrates Part One of the novel in which she tells the story of the events that led up to her eventual capture by the Ormaie Gestapo. Julie is a Scottish woman born into a wealthy family who works in the SOE (Special Operations Executive) organization, and she claims that she is in the organization because she is able to speak both French and German, and she is good at making up stories (Wein 6). In addition to this, she is described as being intelligent, beautiful, & fearless, which is impressive because she remains in captivity with a likely chance of punishment, torture, and even death. Julie is best known for being best friends with Maddie Brodatt, who inevitably fails in preventing Julie’s eventual tragedy.
